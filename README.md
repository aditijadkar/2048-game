How to Play 2048
------------------------
Game Objective:
-------------------
Combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the number 2048.

Game Board:
-------------------
The game board is a 4x4 grid where tiles with numbers appear.

You can move the tiles up, down, left, or right.

If two tiles with the same number collide, they will merge into a single tile with a number equal to the sum of the two tiles.

After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 will randomly appear on an empty spot on the board.

Winning the Game:
---------------------
The game is won when a tile with the number 2048 appears on the board.

Game Over:
---------------
The game is over if there are no empty spots on the board and no valid moves remaining (no adjacent tiles can be merged).
